# Temple Stuart Accounting

Bookkeeping and automation tools for small businesses. Built with Next.js.

## What This Does

I'm building tools to connect your financial accounts and automate the boring stuff. The main idea is to get all your data in one place where you can actually use it.

### Current Features

- **Bookkeeping Dashboard** - See all your accounts in one spot
- **Service Calculator** - Pick what you need, see what it costs
- **Plaid Integration** - Connects to your actual bank accounts
- **Transaction Tracking** - Pulls in all your transactions automatically

## The Tech

- Next.js 15.5.2 
- Tailwind for styling
- PostgreSQL + Prisma for the database
- Plaid for banking connections
- Deployed on Vercel

## Running It Locally

Clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temple-Stuart/temple-stuart-accounting.git
cd temple-stuart-accounting
